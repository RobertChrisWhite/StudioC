        <h2>About Chris White</h2>

        <p>Chris White is a multifaceted music producer and composer from Memphis, TN 
        with a passion for exploring all genres of music. Born and raised in the 
        birthplace of blues and rock 'n' roll, Chris was heavily influenced by these roots 
        and the local hip-hop scene. With over a decade of experience in music production, 
        Chris brings a unique blend of sounds to the table, ranging from pop, hip-hop, 
        rock, classical, blues, indie, and beyond.</p>
        
        <p>Chris got his start in music production in high school, but it wasn't until 
        after his military service that he dove head-first into the industry. Despite 
        balancing school with being a full-time parent, Chris found time to pursue his 
        passion for music and develop his skills. In 2020, he made the decision to fully 
        commit to music production and has since fallen in love with all forms of 
        production, composition, engineering, and sound design.</p>
        
        <p>As a father of three, Chris values family above all else and brings a sense of 
        balance and dedication to his work. He is constantly pushing himself to create 
        the best possible music, and his passion and drive are evident in every beat and 
        chord he produces. With a diverse background and a love for all forms of music, 
        Chris White is a talent to watch in the music industry.</p>
